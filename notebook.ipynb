The location is the first far-reaching decision in a project. When the\n","decision about the location has been made, then it is difficult to change it. With the\n","Traditional site selection is based on economic and geographical factors.\n","off like\n"," Availability of raw materials,\n"," Availability of cheap energy,\n"," Availability of qualified workforce,\n"," good transport links for input materials and end products.\n","6 SAS D Safety and Automation System, see section 11.4.\n","1.3 Plant philosophy 5\n","Consequently, the selection of sites is influenced by political decisions\n","like\n"," Supply of cheap raw materials or raw materials;\n"," financial incentives, for example in the form of low taxes;\n"," Government subsidies of a direct or indirect nature, such as providing\n","from infrastructures.\n","Selection is therefore a very complex and wide-ranging issue. Today's\n","Markets are highly interconnected, well-trained personnel are not readily available, process technology can quickly become obsolete due to new technologies, and the\n","Site selection depends on environmental constraints and potential political upheaval.\n","As a consequence, companies decide on a large number of options and\n","these are based on the evaluation of all identifiable and possible options. This evaluation is the key factor for the site selection, and it consists of\n"," Operating Size Savings,\n"," Government Influences,\n"," Company interest.\n","Plant locations can be divided into two main categories: onshore and\n","the offshore locations. The term onshore or offshore is a term taken from the\n","oil and gas industry and is now also used for other industries (e.g.\n","Wind farms).\n"," Offshore plants are facilities that are installed offshore in the sea. These facilities can be upstream, midstream, or downstream. The focus is on facilities for the extraction and transmission of\n","energies, oils and gases.\n"," Onshore plants are plants that are built on land or near the coast.\n","In addition to the classification of onshore and offshore, it is important to know whether it is a\n","new plant or to upgrade (increase capacity) and modernize (reduce emissions, upgrade products, etc.) or expand a\n","existing plant. According to this, the sites can be classified as greenfield or brownfield.\n","1.3.2 Greenfield plants\n","A \"greenfield\" facility is one that is built on an undeveloped and previously unused industrial site. For a greenfield plant\n","6 1 Basis of the plant design\n","the complete infrastructure usually has to be installed. Greenfield plants are mostly\n","New facilities or facilities that are being relocated.\n","The typical problems with Greenfield are the connections of the plants to the existing infrastructure and the new infrastructure to be built.\n","1.3.3 Brownfield plants\n","A brownfield plant is a plant that is built on a developed site (e.g. brownfield site, industrial park) into an existing plant or subplant or into an industrial complex (e.g. BASF Ludwigshafen, Bayer Leverkusen). Typically\n","are plant expansions to increase production capacities (\"revamp\"), conversions due to process engineering necessities (e.g. environmental regulations) and new plants on industrial sites or brownfields that were previously used for other purposes. In the case of brownfield facilities, part of the infrastructure is usually already in place or is merely being added.\n","\"Brownfields are real property, the expansion, redevelopment, or reuse of which may be\n","be complicated by the presence or potential presence of a hazardous substance, pollutant,\n","or contaminant. Cleaning up and reinvesting in these properties protects the environment,\n","reduces blight, and takes development pressures off green spaces and working lands.\"\n","(United States Environmental Protection Agency 2017)\n","When planning a facility on a brownfield site, one should consider as much as\n","possible to learn about this site in order to get a good overview of site problems\n","and to take them into account in the planning.\n","The typical problems with brownfield plants are:\n","Contamination Contamination is the presence of contamination due to\n","Pollutants in soils or buildings. Decontamination must sometimes be carried out under high\n","effort can be carried out.

These include dead times in the system, such as those\n","supply long pipelines, the hold-up of the apparatus under consideration and the existing\n","regulations. As a result, dynamic simulations are more complex than static ones and clearly\n","more time-consuming to create. They are often only used specifically in areas where the time\n","process of a change is relevant to the process and the higher effort of the dynamic\n","Model creation justified.\n","Typical application areas for dynamic simulations are, for example, load change scenarios for which control concepts have to be created that meet certain boundary conditions.\n","fulfill. One such boundary condition may be, for example, that a temperature is not exceeded during the transition from one state to the other. This\n","Questions are often connected with the safety concept of the plant or the\n","2.9 Process simulation 25\n","Determination of hazards in plant operation. Likewise, dynamic simulation can be used to validate operational procedures or safety protection circuits.\n","be used if the risk assessment or operational constraints preclude an operational test.\n","A special case of the application of dynamic simulators are the so-called Operator Training Systems (OTS, training simulators). These systems allow the operating personnel to practice the operation of a plant before the plant is completed or to train hazardous situations without having to risk endangering the operation. OTS\n","emulate a process with connected process control system in real time. For this\n","a robust and, above all, fast dynamic simulation model is required. In the best case, the user interface of the OTS is identical to that of the later control system. At\n","new plants today, the OTS is very often created in parallel with the engineering.\n","Another special case for dynamic simulations with growing importance is\n","Model Predictive Control (MPC). This is an advanced automation of the multivariable controller (Advanced Process Control, APC). Multivariable controller\n","control a large number of different manipulated variables on the basis of a linearized model of the\n","Control parameters. MPC goes one step further: Here, the predictive specification of the\n","Control variables based on the calculations of a dynamic simulation model.\"\"\""]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":6,"metadata":{"executionInfo":{"elapsed":286,"status":"ok","timestamp":1681447574923,"user":{"displayName":"Arturs Lundbergs","userId":"06134433426942658637"},"user_tz":-120},"id":"mnoimkYKUUw-"},"outputs":[],"source":["#@title Environment Vars\n","openai_api_key = \"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\""]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":7,"metadata":{"executionInfo":{"elapsed":2,"status":"ok","timestamp":1681447574923,"user":{"displayName":"Arturs Lundbergs","userId":"06134433426942658637"},"user_tz":-120},"id":"rPiMl8O3UbFu"},"outputs":[],"source":["import os\n","os.environ[\"OPENAI_API_KEY\"] = openai_api_key"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":8,"metadata":{"executionInfo":{"elapsed":3589,"status":"ok","timestamp":1681447578510,"user":{"displayName":"Arturs Lundbergs","userId":"06134433426942658637"},"user_tz":-120},"id":"oK42enJiUb1V"},"outputs":[],"source":["from langchain.embeddings.openai import OpenAIEmbeddings\n","from langchain.vectorstores.faiss import FAISS\n","from langchain.text_splitter import RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter\n","from langchain import OpenAI, VectorDBQA\n","\n","\n","text_splitter = RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter(chunk_size=1000, chunk_overlap=0)\n","texts = text_splitter.split_text(text_model_input)\n","\n","embeddings = OpenAIEmbeddings()\n","vectorstore = FAISS.from_texts(texts, embeddings)"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":9,"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"executionInfo":{"elapsed":369,"status":"ok","timestamp":1681447578876,"user":{"displayName":"Arturs Lundbergs","userId":"06134433426942658637"},"user_tz":-120},"id":"nEWrAilDUpkq","outputId":"2d7a5e26-4563-4786-a047-839e9859c6f8"},"outputs":[{"name":"stderr","output_type":"stream","text":["/usr/local/lib/python3.9/dist-packages/langchain/chains/retrieval_qa/base.py:185: UserWarning: `VectorDBQA` is deprecated - please use `from langchain.chains import RetrievalQA`\n","  warnings.warn(\n"]}],"source":["qa = VectorDBQA.from_chain_type(llm=OpenAI(), chain_type=\"stuff\", vectorstore=vectorstore)"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":10,"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/","height":53},"executionInfo":{"elapsed":3117,"status":"ok","timestamp":1681447581991,"user":{"displayName":"Arturs Lundbergs","userId":"06134433426942658637"},"user_tz":-120},"id":"JXhZ-O3PUwdM","outputId":"3b64504f-e5f9-4392-a4d3-7f5ca11df6ba"},"outputs":[{"data":{"application/vnd.google.colaboratory.intrinsic+json":{"type":"string"},"text/plain":["' The basis of plant design is composed of the project input data, the project sequence and the plant philosophy.'"]},"execution_count":10,"metadata":{},"output_type":"execute_result"}],"source":["query = \"What is the basis of plant design\"\n","qa.run(query)"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":11,"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/","height":122},"executionInfo":{"elapsed":2120,"status":"ok","timestamp":1681447584107,"user":{"displayName":"Arturs Lundbergs","userId":"06134433426942658637"},"user_tz":-120},"id":"_wpKKfDWii3J","outputId":"e350320d-03eb-49db-96cc-1e7dfeb6f021"},"outputs":[{"data":{"application/vnd.google.colaboratory.intrinsic+json":{"type":"string"},"text/plain":["'\\n\\nThe basis of plant design is to determine the best process configuration, equipment, and layout for a specific production process.
